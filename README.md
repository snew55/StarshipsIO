# StarshipsIO
Welcome to the git repository for StarshipsIO! This game is a full stack web application that utilizes socketIO and NodeJS to have a fun game where the player is a starship and has to shoot asteroids. This game has multiplayer functionality that will hopefully be deployed to the web soon!
